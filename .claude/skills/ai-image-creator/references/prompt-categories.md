## product_hero

**Studio product photography** — Clean, professional shots with controlled lighting.

**Formula:**
```
Create a [lighting] product photograph of [detailed product description]
on/against [surface/background]. Shot with [camera] [lens] at [aperture].
[Lighting description]. [Composition notes]. [Mood/atmosphere].
```

**Key Elements:** Camera hardware, specific surface material, lighting direction/quality, product texture/finish/color, atmosphere

**Example:**
> Create a cinematic product photograph of a matte-black wireless headphone on a polished obsidian surface. Shot with Sony A7R IV, 85mm macro lens at f/2.8, 45-degree product angle. Single soft key light from upper-left creates gentle shadows that define the headphone's contours, with a subtle reflection in the obsidian surface. Deep shadows on the right add drama and luxury. The headphone's ear cushion texture is clearly visible — soft leather grain catching the light. Dark, moody atmosphere with rich tonal depth. 4:5 aspect ratio.

## lifestyle

**Products in real-world settings** — Environmental storytelling with aspirational context.

**Formula:**
```
Create a [mood] lifestyle photograph showcasing [product] in [real-world setting].

```

**Key Elements:** Environmental storytelling, natural lighting, contextual props, aspirational setting, human touch

**Recommended model:** `gemini` or `gpt5`

Warm afternoon light streams through linen curtains, casting soft shadows across the scene. Shot with Sony A7III, 35mm lens at f/2.8. The composition draws the eye from the warm light to the speaker naturally. Aspirational but attainable — the kind of moment you want to step into.
